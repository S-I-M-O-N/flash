# flash
## flash memory tool

Tool for programming 8 bit flash memories with an Arduino Mega, for retrocomputing or whatever. Python 3 and pyserial are necessary for uploading data to the chip.

## Usage:

The script allows reading and writing to the flash. The flash chip can also be erased with the same setup.
This code is basically a small modification of my eprom project:
